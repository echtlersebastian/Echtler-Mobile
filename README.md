# Info:
Welcome to the Code of Echtler-Mobile! ❤
This Project is about creating a nice little website for Echtler-Mobile and add from time to time some fancy features. 
The Goal is to have the whole booking Process incl. invoices and communication inside this Application. But it will be a long way. 😄

# Tech-Stack
  - .NET 6 Backend
  - React Frontend
  - Hosting in Azure (Appservice)
  - EF Core 6.0 
  - Azure SQL

# How to run this
  - use Visual Studio 2022
  - VS2022 should do everything. Just hit run. 😜🤑
  - Check out the Swagger Page at your localhost:xxxxx/swagger 🤓

# Next Steps
  - Currently the Backend is much more advanced than the Frontend. 
  - Price dalculations / booking durations /availability checks and stuff like that is already working in the backend.
  - So the next steps are: Build a Frontend, that uses all the fancy backend Logic. 

# Current Issues
  - Authentication and Login is not 100% clean, but there is currently no productive Data to protect.
  - As soon as there is productive Data in the Database, it will be save. I promise. 😍
